            Literacy is popularly understood as an ability to read and write in at least one method of writing, an understanding reflected by mainstream dictionaries.In this view, illiteracy would be considered to be the inability to read and write.
            Some researchers suggest that the history of interest in the concept of “literacy” can be divided into two periods. Firstly is the period before 1950, when literacy was understood solely as alphabetical literacy (word and letter recognition). Secondly is the period after 1950, when literacy slowly began to be considered as a wider concept and process, including the social and cultural aspects of reading and writing, and functional literacy (Dijanošić, 2009).

            How you take notes is a very personal thing. Do you carefully sub-head, section, and bullet, or quickly scrawl things down anywhere? Are you text-only, or do you use more of a scrapbook system? And how do you index and find old notes? Whatever your approach, there are some great digital note-taking apps out there that can accommodate all your quirks and note-related fancies. 
            Now, one big thing to note. You can write notes on anything: the back of a napkin, an envelope, a ticket stub, and, yes, a notebook. It's the same with apps: you can write notes in a writing app like Ulysses or throw them in a Google Doc or Gmail draft; you can use empty text files or even a sticky notes app. For this list, we weren't interested in apps that could be used as notes apps—we only wanted apps that were explicitly designed to be used as notes apps. This might have excluded the app you personally use, but without this requirement in place, we'd have to consider whether Excel or Google Sheets was more efficient for taking notes.

            A digital classroom is typically one that incorporates electronic devices and software into the learning environment. A digital classroom is where a physical classroom extends into a digital space. The space of a digital classroom must hold potential for collaboration or continuing work outside of the classroom: reflective discussion forums online can be a good way to address this. In a digital classroom, the tone is set by technology. Because technology facilitates easy access to learning resources and networks, it’s easier for students to track their progress and for professors to highlight student work in a digital classroom.
